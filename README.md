CISC182 I08/I09 Doodler Project
By: Julia O'Neill

This project is an Android Studio project written in kotlin that creates a canvas that a user can draw (or doodle) on, they can adjust their brush size, 
the color they want to draw with using an RGB scaler to mix their chosen color, as well as a way to change the color opacity. If the user wants to switch 
up their drawing they can clear the screen and start fresh. If they run into a mistake they can go backwards in lines, and if they go too far back the can 
redo it and get their lines back.
